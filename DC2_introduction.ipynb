    "\n",
    "LSST is planned to map ~20,000 sq-deg of the sky with a median 5-sigma depth of $r \\sim 27.5$. This means that the object density and data volume that LSST will handle will greatly surpass any current astronomy experiment (HSC and Hubble have deeper fields but they are not as wide). This increased statistics increase the cosmological sensitivity but, at the same time, this means that we have to be more careful with the treatment of certain systematic effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the Stony Brook collaboration meeting (Summer 2017) the science working groups (SWGs) provided input for the computing working groups (CWGs) about the kind of projects that they are interested in. The CWGs came up with the specifications of cosmological simulations and image simulations to be analyzed by the SWGs and that will provide a controlled dataset in which to study the different effects in which they were interested. These simulations are the products of the data challenge 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "The DESC data challenges follow an staged approach in which each data challenge builds upon the previous one. The first DESC data challenge was a simplistic 40 sq-deg image simulation of galaxies from CatSim in a single band and with limited realism.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the study cases proposed by the SWGs required significant improvements in both the realism of the image simulations and the underlying galaxy catalogs. For DC2 we started to make these improvements to fulfill the SWGs needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to present the different products available for DC2. More information can be found at:\n",

    "### Galaxy catalog\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying galaxy catalog is a brand-new state-of-the-art simulation. A 5000 sq-deg *extragalactic catalog* based on the Outer Rim N-Body simulation ([Habib et al 2014](http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.2805)) is planned. The catalog is populated using the Galacticus semi-analytic model ([Benson et al. 2010](https://arxiv.org/abs/1008.1786)) which, in order to scale up to LSST densities is accelerated using an emulation approach called GalSampler (Hearin et al., in prep.). This catalog is the so-called `cosmoDC2`. There are now ~700 sq-deg available `cosmoDC2_v1.1.4`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This catalog has a higher resolution and more complicated biasing model than the previous CatSim model based on CatSim. Using the galaxies from this extragalactic catalog we started to generate the image simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Image simulations\n",
    "\n",
    "Two different software packages were used to generate the DC2 images: PhoSim and imSim. PhoSim ([Peterson et al 2015.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06570)) is a Monte Carlo simulator that simulates photons from different astronomical sources and simulates their interaction with the atmosphere, telescope and camera. The galaxies are modeled as Sérsic (bulge+disk) models and stars are point-like sources. On the other hand imSim (Walter et al., in prep.) is a software package based on GalSim ([Rowe et al. 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1407.7676)) that follows a modular approach to generate LSST-like synthetic images. We use information from `lsst_sims` to build the sky-background model (from Yoachim et al.), LSST project optical simulations from Bo Xin to create the optical model (which is added as an extra layer to the atmosphere). The (PSF) atmospheric model is based on PhoSim's model and was developed by Josh Meyers. Effects like cosmic-rays, saturation, the brighter-fatter effect, tree-rings and others were included in imSim for DC2. The galaxies are also represented as Sérsic (bulge+disk) models, and François Lanusse added the functionality to simulate complex galaxy morphologies (also known as *knots*).\n",
